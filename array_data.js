He loves people and he, like any youngster, will need basic manner training and a patient home 
willing to put their time and energy into him. Wishbone also seems to play well with other dogs! 
His perfect doggy pal would be one that can keep up yet be tolerant of his playful antics. He would 
benefit from a home willing to exhaust his energy and keep him active . Wishbone might jump on you 
or play mouth because he is young and still learning. Wishbone will require a home with children 13 
years and older because he gets so playful and excited he doesn't realize his size and strength. He 
truly is a smart young man just needs the right home to spoil him rotten! My past owner went 
through the process of getting me registered as an Emotional Support Animal as well! And I have the 
Certificate to prove it!`,

Cornelia is calm and quiet in their kennel. She needs a home willing to use positive reinforcement 
training to build their confidence. Cornelia is shy on first meeting but if you give her time they 
warm up quickly. She would so best in a calm quiet home due to their personality and demeanor.

Cornelia seems to do well with other dogs and would love a buddy to play with in their new home. We 
would suggest laid back, calm dogs in their new home. They are so low maintenance and calm, a 
hyper, playful dog might stress them out.

We would suggest other dogs and/or children meet them prior to being adopted because we want to 
make sure they do not overwhelm him. In time with TLC, patience, and confidence building they  t 
perfectly into their forever family.`,
